                <p>Since I was at school, I have worried about gender equality and making this society a more equitable place for all by creating awareness about all forms of discrimination. I saw OGA as an opportunity to in my formation as a leader and actor of social change and it worked because the gender discrimination, I’ve focused on is more leaded toward politics, academics and work field. But, with this project I could open my mind and think about and issue I’ve never thought before and that is so close to me as a woman, I menstruate each month and never thought that someone may have sanitary issues when having their periods.</p>

                <p>I have always been fascinated with anatomy and health which lead me to an academic pursuit of knowledge of physiology. I become interest in the topic of reproductive care in high school after going through a lack luster sexual and reproductive education; so through more research on the topic I’ve discovered topic like period poverty and the lack of reproductive care that people have access too. Ever since I have used the topic for multiple research assignments and advocate for reproductive care.</p>

                    Hygienic resources are important for a woman's health, and that in many parts of the world this right to manage menstruation in a healthy and safe way is not taken seriously is something outrageous, that's why I want to contribute in a way to balance the equality of women with men properly. I have seen many women in my school, including myself, have an hygienic emergency like this and not being able to manage it properly because of the bad cleaning of the bathrooms of our school and other schools too. It’s not only about the products, but also about the cleaning of the bathrooms, how they must be suitable and safe for women to manage their period.

                <p>I am concerned with the global issues that my group has focused on because I believe that women should be empowered for their own strength and to also help those around them. They should have the same opportunities as males and be able to work on their on goals. 
                    This will help me in my future career as a PA as I will be more conscience of helping woman who are in need. This could be making sure a young girl has resources to feminine hygiene products or just educating my patients.</p>
